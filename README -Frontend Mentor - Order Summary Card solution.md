## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I am a total beginner in frontend, so I created it from a scratch with a help of freeCodeCamp's YouTube video "HTML / CSS Tutorial â€“ Create an Order Summary Component" (https://youtu.be/SR5GxoFhIAU).
At first, I wrote the code just as it was taught and then I tried to write a code by myself two times. I also learned about the box-shadow code of CSS from a YouTube video "CSS box-shadows - how to make them look good" (https://youtu.be/Yon4l3MUBGY) and applied it.

There is not much to be proud of, since this was a first time for me. However, I did realize that uppercases and lowercases were not paid enough attention in the tutorial video, so I could fix it by myself. Probably I can be pround of that.


### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadows - how to make them look good](https://youtu.be/Yon4l3MUBGY) - It helped me understand how to make box-shadow in CSS, and his YouTube channel seems to have different useful resources for learning CSS.
